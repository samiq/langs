# About Clojure

Clojure is a functional Lisp for the JVM with strong concurrency support, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.

Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime.

Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

## Language Goals
- A Lisp not constrained by backwards compatibility.
- A functional language with a dynamic emphasis (immutable data structures + dynamic polymorphism)
- Symbiotic with an established Platform (VMs, not OSes, are the platforms of the future, Clojure is the language, JVM the platform)
- Designed for Concurrency
