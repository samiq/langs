# About Dart

Dart is an object oriented programming language that’s easy to learn, easy to scale, and deployable everywhere.

Dart is focused on client-side programming, be it in the browser or on mobile, although it's also supported server side using the DartVM.

Dart comes with well-crafted core libraries, a package manager, static analysis tools, and more.

The syntax is designed so that it feels familiar, and the semantics to be clean and consistent. No nasty surprises.

Dart runs fast in every modern browser, on the command line, on servers, and on mobile.

Google alone has over 2 million lines of production Dart code. Apps can reach hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

## Language Goals

- Provide a solid foundation of libraries and tools.
- Make common programming tasks easy (i.e async/await, generators, string interpolation and earlier error detection).
- Don’t surprise the programmer (i.e. avoiding magic)
- Be the stable, pragmatic solution for real apps
